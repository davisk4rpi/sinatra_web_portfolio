					Welcome to Mastermind, here is how it is played.
					 The codemaker will create a #{@x} digit combination using the 
					 numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Duplicates are allowed. The 
					 codebreaker will then have 12 turns to correctly guess the 
					 code. After each guess, the codebreaker will be told how many 
					 numbers were guessed EXACTLY correct (correct number and 
					 placement) and how many were only PARTIALLY correct (correct 
					 number but not placement).

					 Type 1 to be the codebreaker, or 2 to be the codemaker
					 Anything else will exit the game.
